OVERVIEW                                         *devcontainer-overview*

REQUIREMENTS                                     *devcontainer-requirements*

INSTALLATION                                     *devcontainer-installation*

1. Packer.nvim <https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim>

Add the following to your packer setup: >

  use { 'esensar/nvim-dev-container' }
<

2. Plug <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>

Add the following to your vimrc, or something sourced therein: >

  Plug 'esensar/nvim-dev-container'
<
Then install via `:PlugInstall`

3. Manual

Clone this repository and copy the files in plugin/, lua/, and doc/
to their respective directories in your vimfiles, or copy the text from
the github repository into new files in those directories. Make sure to
run `:helptags`.

USAGE                                            *devcontainer-usage*

To use the plugin with defaults just call the `setup` function: >

  require("devcontainer").setup{}
<

It is possible to override some of the functionality of the plugin with options passed into `setup`. Everything passed to `setup` is optional. Following block represents default values: >

  require("devcontainer").setup {
    config_search_start = function()
      -- By default this function uses vim.loop.cwd()
      -- This is used to find a starting point for .devcontainer.json file search
      -- Since by default, it is searched for recursively
      -- That behavior can also be disabled
    end,
    workspace_folder_provider = function()
      -- By default this function uses first workspace folder for integrated lsp if available and vim.loop.cwd() as a fallback
      -- This is used to replace `${localWorkspaceFolder}` in devcontainer.json
      -- Also used for creating default .devcontainer.json file
    end,
    terminal_handler = function(command)
      -- By default this function creates a terminal in a new tab using :terminal command
      -- It also removes statusline when that tab is active, to prevent double statusline
      -- It can be overridden to provide custom terminal handling
    end,
    nvim_dockerfile_template = function(base_image)
      -- Takes base_image and returns string, which should be used as a Dockerfile
      -- This is used when adding neovim to existing images
      -- Check out default implementation in lua/devcontainer/config.lua
      -- It installs neovim version based on current version
    end,
    devcontainer_json_template = function()
      -- Returns table - list of lines to set when creating new devcontainer.json files
      -- As a template
      -- Used only when using functions from commands module or created commands
    end,
    -- Can be set to false to prevent generating default commands
    -- Default commands are listed below
    generate_commands = true,
    -- By default no autocommands are generated
    -- This option can be used to configure automatic starting and cleaning of containers
    autocommands = {
      -- can be set to true to automatically start containers when devcontainer.json is available
      init = false,
      -- can be set to true to automatically remove any started containers and any built images when exiting vim
      clean = false,
      -- can be set to true to automatically restart containers when devcontainer.json file is updated
      update = false,
    },
    -- can be changed to increase or decrease logging from library
    log_level = "info",
    -- can be set to true to disable recursive search
    -- in that case only .devcontainer.json and .devcontainer/devcontainer.json files will be checked relative
    -- to the directory provided by config_search_start
    disable_recursive_config_search = false,
    -- By default all mounts are added (config, data and state)
    -- This can be changed to disable mounts or change their options
    -- This can be useful to mount local configuration
    -- And any other mounts when attaching to containers with this plugin
    attach_mounts = {
      neovim_config = {
        -- enables mounting local config to /root/.config/nvim in container
        enabled = true,
        -- makes mount readonly in container
        options = { "readonly" }
      },
      neovim_data = {
        -- enables mounting local data to /root/.local/share/nvim in container
        enabled = true,
        -- no options by default
        options = {}
      },
      -- Only useful if using neovim 0.8.0+
      neovim_state = {
        -- enables mounting local state to /root/.local/state/nvim in container
        enabled = true,
        -- no options by default
        options = {}
      },
      -- This takes a list of mounts (strings) that should always be added whenever attaching to containers
      -- This is passed directly as --mount option to docker command
      -- Or multiple --mount options if there are multiple vaues
      custom_mounts = {}
    },
    -- This takes a list of mounts (strings) that should always be added to every run container
    -- This is passed directly as --mount option to docker command
    -- Or multiple --mount options if there are multiple vaues
    always_mount = {}
  }

COMMANDS                                         *devcontainer-commands*

If not disabled by using {generate_commands = false} in setup, this plugin provides the following commands:

*:DevcontainerBuild* - builds image from nearest devcontainer.json
*:DevcontainerImageRun* - runs image from nearest devcontainer.json
*:DevcontainerBuildAndRun* - builds image from nearest devcontainer.json and then runs it
*:DevcontainerBuildRunAndAttach* - builds image from nearest devcontainer.json (with neovim added), runs it and attaches to neovim in it - currently using `terminal_handler`, but in the future with Neovim 0.8.0 maybe directly (https://github.com/esensar/nvim-dev-container/issues/30)
*:DevcontainerComposeUp* - run docker-compose up based on devcontainer.json
*:DevcontainerComposeDown* - run docker-compose down based on devcontainer.json
*:DevcontainerComposeRm* - run docker-compose rm based on devcontainer.json
*:DevcontainerStartAuto* - start whatever is defined in devcontainer.json
*:DevcontainerStopAuto* - stop whatever was started based on devcontainer.json
*:DevcontainerStopAll* - stop everything started with this plugin (in current session)
*:DevcontainerRemoveAll* - remove everything started with this plugin (in current session)
*:DevcontainerLogs* - open plugin log file
*:DevcontainerOpenNearestConfig* - opens nearest devcontainer.json file if it exists
*:DevcontainerEditNearestConfig* - opens nearest devcontainer.json file if it exists, or creates a new one if it does not

FUNCTIONS                                        *devcontainer-functions*

This plugin provides multiple modules related to devcontainer functionality,
but not all of them are needed for use tasks. Many of the functionalities are
exposed to enable custom functionality.
