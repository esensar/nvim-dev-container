Goal of this plugin is to provide functionality similar to VSCode's [remote container development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) plugin and other functionality that enables development in docker container. This plugin is inspired by [jamestthompson3/nvim-remote-containers](https://github.com/jamestthompson3/nvim-remote-containers), but aims to enable having neovim embedded in docker container.

## Requirements

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) version 0.10.0+ (previous versions may be supported, but are not tested - commands and autocommands will definitely fail)
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) with included `jsonc` parser (or manually installed jsonc parser)

## Installation

Install using favourite plugin manager.

e.g. Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  'https://codeberg.org/esensar/nvim-dev-container',
  dependencies = 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
}
```

or assuming `nvim-treesitter` is already available:

```lua
{ 'https://codeberg.org/esensar/nvim-dev-container' }
```

## Usage

To use the plugin with defaults just call the `setup` function:

```lua
require("devcontainer").setup{}
```

It is possible to override some of the functionality of the plugin with options passed into `setup`. Everything passed to `setup` is optional. Following block represents default values:

```lua
require("devcontainer").setup {
  config_search_start = function()
    -- By default this function uses vim.loop.cwd()
    -- This is used to find a starting point for .devcontainer.json file search
    -- Since by default, it is searched for recursively
    -- That behavior can also be disabled
  end,
  workspace_folder_provider = function()
    -- By default this function uses first workspace folder for integrated lsp if available and vim.loop.cwd() as a fallback
    -- This is used to replace `${localWorkspaceFolder}` in devcontainer.json
    -- Also used for creating default .devcontainer.json file
  end,
  terminal_handler = function(command)
    -- By default this function creates a terminal in a new tab using :terminal command
    -- It also removes statusline when that tab is active, to prevent double statusline
    -- It can be overridden to provide custom terminal handling
  end,
  nvim_installation_commands_provider = function(path_binaries, version_string)
    -- Returns table - list of commands to run when adding neovim to container
    -- Each command can either be a string or a table (list of command parts)
    -- Takes binaries available in path on current container and version_string passed to the command or current version of neovim
  end,
  devcontainer_json_template = function()
    -- Returns table - list of lines to set when creating new devcontainer.json files
    -- As a template
    -- Used only when using functions from commands module or created commands
  end,
  -- Can be set to false to prevent generating default commands
  -- Default commands are listed below
  generate_commands = true,
  -- By default no autocommands are generated
  -- This option can be used to configure automatic starting and cleaning of containers
  autocommands = {
    -- can be set to true to automatically start containers when devcontainer.json is available
    init = false,
    -- can be set to true to automatically remove any started containers and any built images when exiting vim
    clean = false,
    -- can be set to true to automatically restart containers when devcontainer.json file is updated
    update = false,
  },
  -- can be changed to increase or decrease logging from library
  log_level = "info",
  -- can be set to true to disable recursive search
  -- in that case only .devcontainer.json and .devcontainer/devcontainer.json files will be checked relative
  -- to the directory provided by config_search_start
  disable_recursive_config_search = false,
  -- can be set to false to disable image caching when adding neovim
  -- by default it is set to true to make attaching to containers faster after first time
  cache_images = true,
  -- By default all mounts are added (config, data and state)
  -- This can be changed to disable mounts or change their options
  -- This can be useful to mount local configuration
  -- And any other mounts when attaching to containers with this plugin
  attach_mounts = {
    neovim_config = {
      -- enables mounting local config to /root/.config/nvim in container
      enabled = false,
      -- makes mount readonly in container
      options = { "readonly" }
    },
    neovim_data = {
      -- enables mounting local data to /root/.local/share/nvim in container
      enabled = false,
      -- no options by default
      options = {}
    },
    -- Only useful if using neovim 0.8.0+
    neovim_state = {
      -- enables mounting local state to /root/.local/state/nvim in container
      enabled = false,
      -- no options by default
      options = {}
    },
  },
  -- This takes a list of mounts (strings) that should always be added to every run container
  -- This is passed directly as --mount option to docker command
  -- Or multiple --mount options if there are multiple values
  always_mount = {},
  -- This takes a string (usually either "podman" or "docker") representing container runtime - "devcontainer-cli" is also partially supported
  -- That is the command that will be invoked for container operations
  -- If it is nil, plugin will use whatever is available (trying "podman" first)
  container_runtime = nil,
  -- Similar to container runtime, but will be used if main runtime does not support an action - useful for "devcontainer-cli"
  backup_runtime = nil,
  -- This takes a string (usually either "podman-compose" or "docker-compose") representing compose command - "devcontainer-cli" is also partially supported
  -- That is the command that will be invoked for compose operations
  -- If it is nil, plugin will use whatever is available (trying "podman-compose" first)
  compose_command = nil,
  -- Similar to compose command, but will be used if main command does not support an action - useful for "devcontainer-cli"
  backup_compose_command = nil,
}
```
