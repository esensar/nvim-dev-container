USAGE                                            *devcontainer-usage*

COMMANDS                                         *devcontainer-commands*

FUNCTIONS                                        *devcontainer-functions*

This plugin provides multiple modules related to devcontainer functionality,
but not all of them are needed for use tasks. Many of the functionalities are
exposed to enable custom functionality.

CONFIG FILE FUNCTIONS                            *devcontainer-config-file*

*devcontainer.config_file.jsonc.parse_jsonc(jsonc_string)*
  Parses `jsonc` string into lua table. Relies on |json_decode| (vim.json.decode),
  but cleans up comments that can be found in `jsonc` files which are not
  valid for `JSON`. This functionality relies on |treesitter| and requires
  `jsonc` parser to be installed.

*devcontainer.config_file.parse.parse_devcontainer_config(file_path)*

  Parses the passed `devcontainer.json` file into lua table. Validates the
  file before returning, ensuring it contains all of the required fields
  (either image, dockerfile or docker-compose file). It
  also returns the path to the file as metadata, which is useful if file is
  automatically discovered.
